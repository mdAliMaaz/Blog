In this article, we’ll talk about the apply, call, and bind methods of the function prototype chain. They are some of the most important and often-used concepts in JavaScript and are very closely related to the this keyword.

So, to get a grasp of the information in this article, first you have to be familiar with the concept and use of the this keyword.

Suppose you have an object:

```js
const car = {
	maker: 'Ford',
	model: 'Fiesta',
}
```

and you want to add a method to it:

You could do it like this:

```js
car.drive = function () {
	console.log(`Driving a ${this.maker} ${this.model} car!`)
}
```

and that works.

But suppose you want to have a function access the object properties:

```js
const drive = function () {
	console.log(`Driving a ${this.maker} ${this.model} car!`)
}

drive()
//Driving a undefined undefined car!
```

You can’t, because if you try to use this, it does not point to the object, as the function is defined outside of it.

JavaScript offers the bind() method to map this to any object you want, in this case the car object, and it works like this:

```js
const drive = function () {
	console.log(`Driving a ${this.maker} ${this.model} car!`)
}.bind(car)

drive()
//Driving a Ford Fiesta car!
```

You could also use bind() on an existing object method to remap the value this points to:

```js
const car = {
	maker: 'Ford',
	model: 'Fiesta',

	drive() {
		console.log(`Driving a ${this.maker} ${this.model} car!`)
	},
}

const anotherCar = {
	maker: 'Audi',
	model: 'A4',
}

car.drive.bind(anotherCar)()
//Driving a Audi A4 car!
```

You can perform the same operation, but instead of doing so at the function definition time, you do it at the function invocation step, using call() or apply(),:

```js
const car = {
	maker: 'Ford',
	model: 'Fiesta',
}

const drive = function (kmh) {
	console.log(`Driving a ${this.maker} ${this.model} car at ${kmh} km/h!`)
}

drive.call(car, 100)
//Driving a Ford Fiesta car at 100 km/h!

drive.apply(car, [100])
//Driving a Ford Fiesta car at 100 km/h!
```

The first parameter you pass to call() or apply() is always bound to this.

The difference between call() and apply() is just that the second one wants an array as the arguments list, while the first accepts a variable number of parameters, which passes as function arguments.

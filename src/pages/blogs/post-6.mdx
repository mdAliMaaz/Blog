We all know how to react to **DOM** events such as clicks, mousemove, change, submit etc.
But wait what if i want to create/add custom events , this is how you can do it

## How to create custom events in the browser

You can use the **`Event`** class which is provided by the browser, to create a new event, in this case the event named “hello”:

```js
const anEvent = new Event('hello')
```

Once you have the event, you can trigger the event using

```js
document.dispatchEvent(anEvent)
```

and when this happens, any event listener listening on that event “name” is triggered:

```js
document.addEventListener('hello', (event) => {
	console.log('This is my custom event')
})
```

Thats it , simple right 😊

thanks for reading have a nice day

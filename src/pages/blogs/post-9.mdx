This is the only mandatory HTTP request header

### Authorization

`Authorization: Basic 34i3j4iom2323==`

To pass authentication credentials, for example a token

### Cache-Control

We can set the caching rules using this header.

`Cache-Control: no-cache` tells the server to revalidate the data before sending the response to make sure itâ€™s current
`Cache-Control: max-age=30` tells the server we want data thatâ€™s not older than 30 seconds
